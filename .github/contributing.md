# Contributing

This project is in a _super_ early stage. Right now I'm focused on building up core functionality in the direction of my initial vision for what Fractive can/should be. I'm not really looking to build a team or scale up just yet.

That said, I will still consider pull requests, with bugfixes and core improvements being generally appreciated. Please check out the [Style Guide](https://github.com/invicticide/fractive/blob/dev/.github/code_style.md)!

New features and direction changes I'll probably be a little more leery about... for now, at least. You can check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/invicticide/fractive/blob/dev/.github/roadmap.md) if you're curious what's already planned, or at least being thought about. If there's something else you _really_ want to see make it into Fractive, maybe open an issue for discussion first?

That said, I do _absolutely_ encourage you to write and publish stories using Fractive. Because stories are 100% self-contained, you don't have to worry about your published stories breaking as the tool receives updates (though you can always re-export your story to pick up the latest features if you want). You can publish your stories on your own website, on a site like [itch.io](https://itch.io), or wherever else html pages can be served.

Don't submit pull requests containing stories; this repo is for the Fractive tool, not for the stories made with the tool.
