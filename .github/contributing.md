# Contributing

This project is in a _super_ early stage. Right now I'm focused on building up core functionality in the direction of my initial vision for what fractive can/should be. I'm not really looking to build a team or scale up just yet.

That said, I will still consider pull requests, with bugfixes and core improvements being generally appreciated.

New features and direction changes I'll probably be a little more leery about... for now, at least. If there's something you _really_ want to see make it into fractive, maybe open an issue for discussion before generating a big ol' pile of code?

That said, I do _absolutely_ encourage you to write and publish stories using fractive. Because stories are 100% self-contained, you don't have to worry about your published stories breaking as the tool receives updates (though you can always re-export your story to pick up the latest features if you want). You can publish your stories on your own website, on a site like [itch.io](https://itch.io), or wherever else html pages can be served.

Don't submit pull requests containing stories; this repo is for the fractive tool, not for the stories made with the tool.

I'll probably come back to this doc later and add more details about the vision and roadmap and... stuff.
