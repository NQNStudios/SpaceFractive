{{Start}}

This is the first section. It's called "Start" which is a special section name that indicates where the story begins.

[Go to the next section]({@AnotherSection})

{{AnotherSection}}

This is the second passage. It is even better and more purer, because now we're gonna insert some text from a function call, and we're gonna wrap it in some Markdown blockquote formatting:

>{#InlineText}

Notice that the first section is still displayed above. That's because we keep track of your play history in a scrollback. [Hide history]({#ToggleHistory})

{{AboutFormatting}}

Story text is written in Markdown, which means we have access to *all kinds* of **formatting**, including:

- Unordered lists (like this one)
- Ordered lists (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- [Links that call Javascript functions]({#RaiseAlert}), as well as [vanilla hyperlinks to other websites](https://google.com)
- Links can also [*contain* **formatting**]({#RaiseAlert})

# Headers

## Sub-headers

Basically, anything Markdown can do, you can do in your story text! You can even inline <span style="color:#ff0000">raw HTML</span> which means you could do video embeds, HTML5 canvas, and all kinds of other fancy stuff.

(This is the end of this example.)
