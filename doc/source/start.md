Fractive is a hypertext authoring tool, primarily intended for the creation of interactive fiction.

Stories are written in Markdown, and (optional) game logic is added with Javascript.

Fractive has three core goals:

- Keep story text readable, unencumbered by the details of scripted game logic and with minimal additional syntax
- Use complete, standard Javascript for game logic, instead of a limited subset of proprietary macros
- Compile finished stories to a single, self-contained, portable HTML file which can be played on any (reasonable) browser, platform, and/or device

# Conventions

{icon-inline-link} appears on links which expand in-place to reveal more detailed information about the topic.
